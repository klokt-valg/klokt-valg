## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m klokt-valg

Iâ€™m a **full-stack engineer** with a curiosity that never quits. Most of my time is spent building and integrating web apps and APIsâ€”primarily using **Python** and **TypeScript/JavaScript** (but my language toolkit is much broader). About 80% of my work revolves around web development, while the rest is dedicated to exploring other technical adventures.

I have a solid background in **DevOps**, with hands-on experience in **Linux**, **Docker/Kubernetes**, and various **cloud services**. Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into **AI** and **Blockchain** technologiesâ€”because who isnâ€™t, right?

ðŸ”§ **Tech Stack Highlights:**  
- **Languages:** Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and more  
- **Web:** RESTful APIs, modern web frameworks  
- **DevOps:** Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Cloud platforms

Iâ€™m passionate about engineering and see myself doing this for life. Outside of code, Iâ€™m a quiet observerâ€”I keep my professional and personal life very separate, and youâ€™ll usually find me as a passive consumer rather than an active sharer online.
